                Through pursuing my degree in computer science as well as in my own time,
                I have developed skills and experience in a variety of programming languages
                and frameworks. The strongest of which are included in in this section.  
            </p>
            <p className="lnf-p">
                Languages I learned predominately in college include C++, C, Python, and Java.
                Outside of the classroom, I spent my own time developing skills in C#, Javascript, 
                SQL, HTML, and CSS. In addition, I have invested my time into practicing and 
                developing my abilities in frameworks and libraries like React, ASP.NET Core, 
                Flask, Node.js, and Gunicorn. Doing so has given me a desire to contonue learning
                more and becoming the best developer I can be. All togther, the time and dedication I 
                put into learning these tools and putting them to real use has made me into a superior 
                problem solver and application developer.
